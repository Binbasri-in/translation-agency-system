More SQL: Complex Queries, 
Triggers, Views, and  
Schema Modification
This chapter describes more advanced features of 
the SQL language for relational databases. We start 
in Section 7.1 by presenting more complex features of SQL retrieval queries, such as nested queries, joined tables, outer joins, aggregate functions, and grouping, and case statements. In Section 7.2, we describe the 
CREATE ASSERTION  statement, 
which allows the specification of more general constraints on the database. We also introduce the concept of triggers and the 
CREATE TRIGGER  statement, which will 
be presented in more detail in Section 26.1 when we present the principles of active databases. Then, in Section 7.3, we describe the SQL facility for defining views on the database. Views are also called virtual  or derived tables  because they present the 
user with what appear to be tables; however, the information in those tables is derived from previously defined tables. Section 7.4 introduces the SQL 
ALTER 
TABLE  statement, which is used for modifying the database tables and constraints. 
Section 7.5 is the chapter summary.
This chapter is a continuation of Chapter 6. The instructor may skip parts of this 
chapter if a less detailed introduction to SQL is intended.
7.1 More Complex SQL Retrieval Queries
In Section 6.3, we described some basic types of retrieval queries in SQL. Because of 
the generality and expressive power of the language, there are many additional fea-tures that allow users to specify more complex retrievals from the database. We discuss several of these features in this section.chapter  7
